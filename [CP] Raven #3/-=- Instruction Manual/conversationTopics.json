        //Can trigger one-time NPC dialogue (if they have a matching dialogue key)
        //Stored in Farmer.activeDialogueEvents while active -> moved from into Farmer.previousActiveDialogueEvents once they expire
    //Schedule days between events
        //Once a topic is added, you can have a subsequent event precondition only satisfied if the topic is not active

//Topic memory
    //Topics are also tracked based on how long ago topics were set and automatically generates additional topics after a certain number of days
    //These topics always use the original key and append _memory_<time> to it
        //(please note: the game checks for keys to contain the string "_memory_" to control its behavior here, so you should avoid using that string in your topic IDs if possible).
    //Default keys
"<key>_memory_oneday": "1 day since _key_ was active",
"<key>_memory_oneweek": "7 days since _key_ was active",
"<key>_memory_twoweeks": "14 days since _key_ was active",
"<key>_memory_fourweeks": "28 days since _key_ was active",
"<key>_memory_eightweeks": "56 days since _key_ was active",
"<key>_memory_oneyear": "104 days since _key_ was active",
        //Note that the _memory_oneyear key entry is not a typo, and starts after 104 days, which is slightly less than one full year (112 days).

//Generic topics
    //These topics are generated by the game in response to the player fulfilling certain conditions. These topics automatically cover any mods that add data alongside vanilla, so (for example) any mod-added events will generate eventSeen_ topics, any NPCs will generate married_ when the player marries them, etc. Combined with topic memory, this gives you a lot of power to time events and coordinate NPC behavior without having to do any extra work.

    //Default keys
        //All of these topics last for four days.
