## 2 Heart - Forgot to dress

debug ebi 75160128

>Oh! Uh... Hello, @.

>Um... I'm so sorry, but I must have fallen asleep... I was reading a fascinating book on sequelae of specific adolescent adverse events... I probably wandered out here to get something..?

>I was terriby drowsy after my bath...

>Oh, sorry! I'm fine! I just can't remember... I think I forgot something out here.

>Not dressed? What are you saying?

>Of course I'm-

>OH!

>O-Oh, Yoba! Oh, no!

>I... I... I fell asleep out here l-last night!

>EEP!!

>Oh my Yoba, oh my Yoba, oh my Yoba!

>T-That was... that was mortifying!

>Oh, Yoba, what if someone saw me last night?

>It's a hotel, what are the chances someone didn't?!

>H-How am I ever going to look anyone in the face e-ever again?

>Breathe, Flor. Breathe.

>Look on the bright side! A-at least @ told me before more people saw me!

>Umm... @?

>I... uh...

>Y-You can come in. I need to tell you something...

>H-Hey, Flor... I... um. T-Thank you for telling me about my... Uh... about the t-towel.

>I'm really sorry you had to see that!

>I know it's hard to believe, but I genuinely didn't notice!

>I just was so focused on my book and I've always slept like a log and been disoriented for a while right after I wake up and---

>I'm sorry!

#### It's okay. You were just really tired. I didn't see anything...
>Huh? ... R-Really?

>That's good to know... I-I'm glad.

>Umm. S-So.

>Thank you for telling me, @. A-And please, um... please don't tell anyone else?

>I know you won't, but I just... um. W-Wanted to ask...

>I-I hope you have a good day!

>C-Can I just go back to bed now?

>Yoba, I hope no one saw me last night...

#### Be more careful next time.
>I-I-I know! I definitely will! Absolutely!

>This will never happen again!

>I-it can't, or I'd implode...

>Umm. S-So.

>Thank you for telling me, @. A-And please, um... please don't tell anyone else?

>I know you won't, but I just... um. W-Wanted to ask...

>I-I hope you have a good day!

>C-Can I just go back to bed now?

## 4 Heart - Flor trips

debug ebi 75160129

>Whoa!!

>Oww...

>That hurt...

>Huh? @!?

>You caught me?

>I hope I didn't hurt you!

>Umm... T-Thank you.

>Oh! I'm sorry!

>I'm really sorry!

>Oh, I have given you the w-worst impressions of me...

>Um... I t-think I better go.

>I'm a mess...

>Ouch...

>Ow!!

>Owww...

>I think I hurt my ankle...

>Can you help me up?

>Ouch! Ouch!

>That hurts!

>Gently please, @...

>What did I do to myself now...

>@! Hey! You don't have to carry me! I'm fine!

>Really, I-- Agh!!

>M-Maybe I'm not that fine...

>Okay, okay... Can you help me to the clinic?

>Making more great impressions, Flor...

>Okay, doctor...

>Hey, uh... @?

>Thank you...

>I really appreciate you helping me all the way here...

>I should be able to at least get back on my own, now that my ankle's all wrapped up.

>So, um... Thank you.

>And... I'm sorry about all the awkward interactions w-we keep having...

>I really must seem like a terrible mess...

>So... See you.

>Ow.

>Okay, easy does it...

>What?

>Um, I wouldn't mind if you accompanied me back to the hotel... That would actually be really helpful...

>Thank you so much, @.

## 6 Heart - Flor plans research

debug ebi 75160129

>Hm?

>Oh! ... I'm sorry, I was lost in thought.

>Um... I'm actually trying to figure something out.

>Well, um... So...

>I've been inspired by a recent publication about interactions between peers with the same interests.

>I want to explore a similar research question, but wiht different subjects.

>Come take a look at this.

>So, um... I plan to use a similar protocol, but instead of peers with the same interests...

>... I'll have peers with different interests try to converse with one another.

>I'll tell them to find *something* to talk about, anything, but otherwise leave them alone and see how they start a conversation. How long will it take?

>What will they talk about? What if they don't talk at all? Would people rather sit in silence than talk about something superficial?

>Oh, excuse me for a moment.

>I get a migraine when I wear these for too long

>So, as I was saying...

#### Flor goes into detail about the experiment she's planning. She seems nervous at first, as if she thinks she's boring you... but when you keep listening and then start to ask questions, she gets mroe and more enthusiastic.

#### As she's explaining the trickier points of designing ethical social experiments, she locks eyes with you and -- unusually for her -- doesn't immediately look away.

#### You're struck by how vulnerable she seems. You're seeing her eyes without thte barrier of her glasses; but more than that, you're seeing her passion, unchecked and unfiltered.

#### Eventually, seeming to realize that she's been making direct eye contact for a while, she trails off self-consciouslly and ducks behind her book again.

>Um, I'm sorry if I got carried away there...

>I know that was a  lot to unload on you when this isn't even your field... I mean, your field *of expertise*, not... with the crops... um...

>So! Um... @...

>I... I was hoping you'd... You'd he-help me... with my... um...

>Research... this research, I mean!

>I... don't know anyone else well enough to ask them... so, um...

>Plea-please, @... I mean! If it's not an imposition...

>You will?! Thank you, @! I really appreciate this!

#### Flor smiles, relieved.

>Um, I'll send you a letter when I've got all the forms and things ready...

>I'm sorry for being so awkward. It's... it's hard for me to tell when I'm overstepping, um, socially...

>So... I hope to see you soon, @...

>And... um... yeah!

#### Flor whispers to herself:
>Calm down! It went fine. Everything's fine!

>Why do I always do this?

## 8 Heart - Flor's research (Romantic)

debug ebi 75160132

>Okay. All set!

>@, thank you for agreeing to help me with this! You'll be acting as an independent observer.

>That means you and I will record data about the participants' conversations separately. I've created a form we can use to standardize our observations.

>When assessing subjective criteria, it's important to have multiple observers so the results aren't influenced by any one experimenter's cognitive biases.

>Ready? Let's begin!

>Welcome, Shane. Welcome, Ysabelle.

>Today, the two of you will...

#### Flor reads our a set of pre-written instructions.

>That won't be a problem.

>Go on, don't be shy. Talk about anything you want for the next 15 minutes.

>Hmm... Interesting...

#### Flor is intrigued.

>... I still need to run a statistical analysis, but my preliminary conclusion... is that, um...

>Ugh... I feel a migraine coming on.

>Oh! Thank you, @.

>There...

>I can take those back n--

>Whoa!

#### Flor trips on a rock and lands in your arms.

>Oh! Again!? ...

>Thank... Thank you for catching me...

>I'm sorry I'm so clumsy...

>Hehe... Remember that time I fell down those stairs? You caught me then, too...

>Um... @...

>I, um...

>Would... Would it be okay if I kissed you?

>I'm so glad we're together, @.

>Physical touch can be overwhelming for me... But I don't always mind it when it's you.

>I'm sorry, I'm not good at expressing these things. I'm usually the one listening to someone else talk about their feelings...

>But, um... I'll put it this way. I was about to tell you the preliminary conclusion to my research.

>Every person has their own unique combination of traits, history, interests and personality...

>And yet, even two individuals who are different in all of these respects can still connect, sometimes in unpredictable ways.

>Like... Like how I got to connect with you.

#### Flor seems to have become quite comfortable with you. And it sounds like her experiment was a success, too!

## 10 Heart - Flor locks herself out

debug ebi 75160133

>@! Help me!

>I accidentally locked myself out of my room...

>Umm... I'm so sorry for this...

>Umm... Please don't look at me too much.

>I think we need to break down the door...

>It's open!

>Come on...

>I'm really sorry again, @...

>I appreciate you helping me...

>I always seem to be getting into situations like this...

>I'm really sorry...

>I must be back luck, right?

>Really, though... I don't know why I'm so clumsy...

>I hope you still want me even though I'm like this...

>Umm... I'm here all embarrassed in front of you again...

>I'm thankful you're always willing to help me out, @.

>I'm really happy I'm in your arms...

>In all my years studying human social behavior and relationships to further better my skills as an occupational therapist...

>I never thought I'd be able to experience such an amazing relationship with such an amazing person.

>I... I love you, @.

>Don't go yet...

>Stay in my room for a while, please...

## 14 Heart - Flor's insecure - Part 1

debug ebi 75160225

>@?

>Am I a good wife?

>In terms of efficiency, quality, appearance, effort, honesty...

#### Flor proceeds to mention many more variables.

>Hmm... Did I miss anything?

>No, wait. Before you answer that.

>I think I'd need to undergo some practical test.

>Ah! A date perhaps!

>I shall orchestrate the perfect romantic activity for us!

>I'm looking forward to it!

>Until then, hold off your answer from my question earlier until after my evaluation.

>Okay?

>Meet me at the Log Cabin Hotel tonight, @.

>Between 8PM and 10PM.

>Dress up casually, or formally if you wish, alright?

>I'll see you there!

## 14 Heart - Flor's Date - Part 2

debug ebi 75160226

>Everything seems to be in order...

>Wait... No. It feels like something's still incorrect.

>@!

>I feel like I'm missing something!

>I don't think what I've prepared is enough!

>See, look at this book!

>I'm missing photographers, fireworks, more lights, rose petals-

>You don't mind?

>But-but!

>I assumed the perfect date is only possible if I follow this book word-by-word.

>I'm confused!

>Won't this failure make for an unideal wife?

#### You hug Flor.

>@?

>Wha-what's wrong?

>You mean, I didn't have to do any of this?

>I just wanted to make you happy.

>I'm sorry if I was too much...

>I must've given everyone a hard time with the last-minute favors.

>I don't even know if this dress is appealing to you...

>@...

>I--

>I'm happy...

>I'm happy I married you...

>I hope you are too...
