    "dialogue.6heart.4": "What kind of secrets do I hide from people?#$b#Only the ones that I feel people would judge me for. I think that could be said for most peoples' secrets though, right?",

    "dialogue.8heart.4": "It's good to have a friend that's supportive of me, and I'm glad you can be that friend for me.",
    "dialogue.8heart.5": "I thought I wouldn't find true friendship with anyone in Pelican Town. I thought I'd need to be really superficial for probably the rest of my life.#$b#With you, I can be my authentic self. That's something you can't put a price on.",
    "dialogue.8heart.6": "In small towns, you sometimes have to be fake in order to fit in and feel like you could maybe belong with everyone else.#$b#You're not like everyone else, though. I like that about you a lot.",
