    "dialogue.0heart.3": "It's nice that Pelican Town is calm and not much goes on.#$b#Where I come from, there were some... unusual incidents that would happen. You won't find anything like that out here, though.",

    "dialogue.2heart.2": "I guess the thing that sucks about Pelican Town is how everything seems to be good all the time.#$b#I'm sure people have their secrets, but it doesn't make the community intriguing.#$e#I could just be feeling a little homesick for Jericho, though...",
    "dialogue.2heart.3": "You're curious about my family life? Well, there's not much to talk about.#$b#As much as I'd like to be close to my father, we just never really... got along like that, especially the older I got.#$e#What about your family?",
    "dialogue.2heart.4": "I sometimes wish I had a deeper connection with my father.#$b#I think part of what held us back for so long was how he would hardly ever talk about my mother.#$e#It felt like my father was keeping secrets from me, you know?",
    "dialogue.2heart.5": "Have you been getting along fine in Pelican Town?#$e#Sometimes, it's about meeting the right people to make you feel at home in a new place.",

    "dialogue.4heart.1": "Have you met any strange people before?#$b#I've met people back home that could shock you just from touching your hand. It's kinda like one of those hand buzzers.#$e#I swear I didn't see a hand buzzer in that guy's hand though...",
    "dialogue.4heart.2": "Back in Jericho, there were plenty of average people, but there was a group of people that went to this private school called Nevermore Academy.#$b#Each of the students there had something different about them. They were all considered outcasts in some way.#$e#Who would think private school kids would be seen as the outcasts?",
    "dialogue.4heart.3": "Do you have any special abilities like seeing visions?#$b#I only ask because there were people will all kinds of abilities back where I was raised.",
    "dialogue.4heart.4": "What's the strangest thing I've seen back in Jericho?#$b#Well... It's hard for me to choose, but there was a disembodied hand that was able to just... function entirely on its own without a body attached to it.",
    "dialogue.4heart.5": "I find it cool how there's a wizard that lives in town.#$b#It reminds me of some of the odd things that would happen back home in Jericho. He seems like a cool guy... I think?",
    "dialogue.4heart.6": "Back when I used to live in Jericho, it felt like everyone was keeping secrets. It's not like that in Pelican Town at least.",
    "dialogue.4heart.7": "Do I have secrets?#$b#Well... doesn't everyone have secrets?",
    //6 Hearts
    "dialogue.6heart.1": "It can be hard for me to open up to people, especially since I haven't seen people model that in my own life.#$b#If it feels like I'm not being as open as I could be, that's why.",
    "dialogue.6heart.2": "You want me to talk more about myself?#$b#Geez... That's kinda hard...#$b#That's so vague, you're going to need to be more specific than that for me to give any answers.",
    "dialogue.6heart.3": "Do I have any abilities?#$b#... I am a Hyde... Just like my mother was...#$e#It's part of why my father hardly talked about my mother in the first place...",
    "dialogue.6heart.4": "What do I know about Hydes?#$b#Well, at least for my mother and I, our forms only come about due to trauma, chemical induction, or through hypnosis.#$b#I've learned to keep my Hyde form under control over the years. It can get ugly fast... trust me.",
    "dialogue.6heart.5": "What kind of secrets do I hide from people?#$b#Only the ones that I feel people would judge me for. I think that could be said for most peoples' secrets though, right?",
    "dialogue.6heart.6": "When did I figure out I was Hyde?#$b#Well, I didn't figure that out until I turned into one when I was still in high school. It wasn't pleasant, I'll say that much.",
    "dialogue.6heart.7": "Do you feel like it could be hard for someone to love you for who you really are?#$b#That's how I feel about being a Hyde, even if I do have it under control now.",
    //8 Hearts
    "dialogue.8heart.1": "You know, it's great that I've gotten to know you as much as I do now. It can be hard building friendships with new people.#$b#Depending on how you're feeling, maybe it oculd lead to something more?",
    "dialogue.8heart.2": "Even after telling you about me being a Hyde, you still choose to talk to me.#$b#It's comforting to know you're not one to judge who I am.",
    "dialogue.8heart.3": "Back when I first discovered I was a Hyde, I eventually got sent away.#$b#I did some... terrible things when I was in my Hyde form... I needed to get better.#$e#It may not seem like it, but the time I spent there really helped me to learn self-control. It was actually good for me, even if it didn't feel that way at the time.",
    "dialogue.8heart.4": "What kind of things did I do when I was in my Hyde form?#$b#... I guess I can be honest about it with you.#$b#I... hurt people... really badly... Some of them weren't able to recover, if you catch my drift. I feel guilty about it, even to this day.",
    "dialogue.8heart.5": "There was a period of time where I went to Harvey for advice about my condition. He's very well-versed in a variety of species.#$b#He told me as long as I maintain self-control and keep my mood regulated, I should be fine.",
    "dialogue.8heart.6": "Have I turned into a Hyde recently? Nope, I've been doing very well with keeping myself under control for the past couple of years.",
    "dialogue.8heart.7": "You know, you're an amazing person.#$b#I wouldn't mind trying something more with you, but it's entirely up to you.",

    "dialogue.10heart.3": "I wish you could meet my father. You're such a great person, I think he would be really happy to get to know you.#$b#He... passed away due to unforunate circumstances. But I think he'd like you.",
    "dialogue.10heart.4": "My day gets so much better whenever I see you. How are you doing, @?",
    "dialogue.10heart.5": "Has anyone told you that you look amazing today?#$b#I got you to smile, didn't I?",
    "dialogue.10heart.6": "Hey @, don't forget to take a break if you need it. It's no good to push yourself too hard.",
    "dialogue.10heart.7": "I love you, don't forget that, okay? You really mean a lot to me.",
