>Oh! Uh... Hello, @.
>Um... I'm so sorry, but I must have fallen asleep... I was reading a fascinating book on sequelae of specific adolescent adverse events... I probably wandered out here to get something..?
I was terriby drowsy after my bath...
Oh, sorry! I'm fine! I just can't remember... I think I forgot something out here.
Not dressed? What are you saying?
Of course I'm-
OH!
O-Oh, Yoba! Oh, no!
I... I... I fell asleep out here l-last night!
EEP!!
Oh my Yoba, oh my Yoba, oh my Yoba!
T-That was... that was mortifying!
Oh, Yoba, what if someone saw me last night?
It's a hotel, what are the chances someone didn't?!
H-How am I ever going to look anyone in the face e-ever again?
Breathe, Flor. Breathe.
Look on the bright side! A-at least @ told me before more people saw me!
Umm... @?
I... uh...
Y-You can come in. I need to tell you something...
H-Hey, Lila... I... um. T-Thank you for telling me about my... Uh... about the t-towel.
I'm really sorry you had to see that!
I know it's hard to believe, but I genuinely didn't notice!
I just was so focused on my book and I've always slept like a log and been disoriented for a while right after I wake up and---
I'm sorry!
[Response 1]
    Huh? ... R-Really?
    That's good to know... I-I'm glad.
    Umm. S-So.
    Thank you for telling me, @. A-And please, um... please don't tell anyone else?
    I know you won't, but I just... um. W-Wanted to ask...
    I-I hope you have a good day!
    C-Can I just go back to bed now?
    Yoba, I hope no one saw me last night...
[Response 2]
    I-I-I know! I definitely will! Absolutely!
    This will never happen again!
    I-it can't, or I'd implode...
    Umm. S-So.
    Thank you for telling me, @. A-And please, um... please don't tell anyone else?
    I know you won't, but I just... um. W-Wanted to ask...
    I-I hope you have a good day!
    C-Can I just go back to bed now?
    Yoba, I hope no one saw me last night...
[Response 3]
    W-what? I-I... uh...
    ... {frown}
    ... {blush smile}
    ... {frown}
    P-Please leave, Lila...
    Now.
