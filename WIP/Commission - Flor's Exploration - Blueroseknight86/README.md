>Oh! Uh... Hello, @.</br>

>Um... I'm so sorry, but I must have fallen asleep... I was reading a fascinating book on sequelae of specific adolescent adverse events... I probably wandered out here to get something..?<br/>

>I was terriby drowsy after my bath...</br>

>Oh, sorry! I'm fine! I just can't remember... I think I forgot something out here.</br>

>H-How am I ever going to look anyone in the face e-ever again?</br>

>I'm really sorry you had to see that!</br>

>I know it's hard to believe, but I genuinely didn't notice!</br>

>I'm sorry!</br>

#### It's okay. You were just really tired. I didn't see anything...</br>
>Huh? ... R-Really?</br>

>I-I hope you have a good day!

>C-Can I just go back to bed now?

>Yoba, I hope no one saw me last night...

#### Be more careful next time.
>I-I-I know! I definitely will! Absolutely!

>This will never happen again!

>I-it can't, or I'd implode...

>Umm. S-So.

>Thank you for telling me, @. A-And please, um... please don't tell anyone else?

>I know you won't, but I just... um. W-Wanted to ask...

>I-I hope you have a good day!
