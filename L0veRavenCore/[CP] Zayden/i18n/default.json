I'm not super social, but I figured I'd still welcome you to Pelican Town.^^It's not hard to fit in here, honestly. Everyone is pretty chill as long as you don't go slingshotting people left and right. Trust me, it's a long story about an old resident. He doesn't live here anymore, so you're safe.^^Anyways, welcome to Pelican Town and I hope you enjoy your stay. Since you're starting out with farming, have some seeds. My family still gifts them to me even though I can't grow crops in my apartment. Good luck.^^- Zayden",
